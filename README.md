# Apply Localization and Internationalization

A Flutter application that shows localization (L10n) and internationalization (i18n) according to the locale that is chosen. Three languages are supported by the app: English, Vietnamese, and Japanese. Depending on the language selected, the default currency is automatically changed to the relevant one.

## Features

- **Localization:** Provides localized strings, dates, and currency forms for English, Vietnamese, and Japanese.
- **Currency Conversion:** Depending on the language selected, this feature automatically changes a preset amount to the relevant currency.
- **Dynamic Language Switching:** The application dynamically modifies text and currency formats, and users can choose from a dropdown menu of supported languages.
